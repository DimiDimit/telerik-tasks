# Telerik Tasks
### Tasks given to me by [Telerik](http://telerikacademy.com).
**NOTE:** Some of these tasks _may_ be incomplete and if so, they are most likely abandoned.

**NOTE:** The games in the [HTML5](HTML5) folder are written in JavaScript using the HTML canvas and some functions defined by Iashu (Telerik's main teacher). He uploaded the library [here](http://iashu.free.bg/code.zip). The [Template](HTML5/Template) folder found with the games is a slightly modified version of Iashu's library (which I suggest using, but if you're following the [online tutorials](http://telerikacademy.com), you probably shouldn't use it unless you know what you're doing). To create a new game, run the [new.bat](HTML5/new.bat) file in the HTML5 folder with an argument of the name of the game you want to create (if it contains spaces, put it in quotes!). It is currently just an `xcopy`, but for future compatibility and to save yourself some typing (`xcopy Template "<my game>"` -> `new "<my game>"`) I suggest using it.

_BTW, all hail [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com) and their awesome tools!!! They are very powerful **if you know what you're doing**! But if you're following the tutorials, I suggest using the tools they said, i.e. [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org) and [Brackets](http://brackets.io)._
